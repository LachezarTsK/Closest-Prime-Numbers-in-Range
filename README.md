-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the presented solutions is to demonstrate the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
The results of the creation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes are deliberately stored in static fields
(Java, C++, C#, Kotlin), respectively in global fields (JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang),
 in order to increase the overall efficiency for all test cases. 

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is created for all possible input values, namely, from 1 to pow(10, 6),
and then each test case takes this portion of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which concerns 
its own lower and upper limit. The number of test cases and the input range for all possible values,
as of March 2025, warrants such an approach to the problem.
